# Goal
Making an agent learn how to play super mario bros using Q-Learning. 

# Libraries
gym-super-mario-bros is used to define the environment,

# Action/State-space
In order for Q-Learning to work we need both discrete action and state spaces. A discrete action space can be achieved by mapping different button presses to actions like right,jump,do nothing, etc. 
A discrete state space can be achieved by mapping x and y coordinates of mario to states.
Ignoring potential State Aliasing for now
